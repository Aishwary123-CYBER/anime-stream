            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Anime (pronounced AH-nee-may ) is a term for a style of Japanese comic book and video cartoon animation in which the main characters have large doe-like eyes. Many Web sites are devoted to anime. Anime is the prevalent style in Japanese comic books or manga . In Japan, the comic book is a popular form of entertainment for adults as well as for younger audiences. Story lines are often very sophisticated and complex and extend into episodic series. Typical anime themes or genres include Ninja and other martial arts; the supernatural or horror story; the romance; and science fiction including robots and space ships. Foils for the main characters, including robots, monsters, or just plain bad people, often lack the doe-eyed quality..</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Actually Japanese animation is called Anime while the western animation is called cartoons

                In general animes are very realistic unless it’s a fantasy anime can include bloodshed, violence and goer where as cartoons are generally for kids which can also be enjoyable by adults.</p>

            <h2 class="text-gray-900 text-lg title-font font-medium mb-3">Why Anime is better?</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Even as a child, I sensed something different about cartoons like Robotech and Voltron. Compared to other shows, they struck me as serious, dramatic and stylish. Each episode contributed to a longer narrative and when something changed, it remained that way for the rest of the series. The straight-lined art affected me me in a way other cartoons' softer, rounded styles never did.

                Something was different, though I couldn't put my finger on it.
                
                At the time I didn't know these cartoons came from Japan, where they had different titles, and occasionally different narratives. I didn't know that one day I'd become a fan of the medium, a style of cartoon called anime.
                
                Anime differed from standard Western cartoons. Back then anime fans would tell you, Japanese anime is better. Cartoons are "kids' stuff." With complicated stories, deep character development and themes fit for adults, anime eschews the label of cartoon and makes claims on being a higher art-form.
                
                Of course anime's visuals fuel its purported pedigree. Fans laud anime for its detailed art, style and fluid animation. Wait… fluid animation?!.</p>
